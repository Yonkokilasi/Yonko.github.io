        <h3>Why Did I decide to do programming?</h3>
                    I love telling this story.Ok here it comes.........
                    I first started programming when I'd see my friends in the computer lab learning how to code on codecademy. <strong>DISCLAIMER!!</strong> I am not advertising for codecademy... but I could be ;)Back to the story I started by learning Java Script.I made abit of progress but then I got stuck for about 5 months :(
                    From there I proceeded to enroll for a coding bootcamp held at USIU-Africa by <strong>TECH REPUBLIC AFRICA</strong> :Find them <a href="http://www.techrepublicafrica.com/" target="_blank">here</a>
                    That is where I fell in love with programming mainly game design.A few code camps later and here I am at Moringa School.Hoping to make the best of my experience and develop my application (MA3 KENYA) and make a difference in Kenya so help me GOD.
